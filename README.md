<h2>Air Quality Data Exploration Project</h2>
<h3>Goal:</h3>
<p>
To identify the location within New York City that exhibit the highest levels of air pollutants 
based on the provided surveillance data, and to determine the major air pollutants contributing
to these elevated levels as represented in the dataset's values.
</p>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
This data exploration project analyzed New York City air quality surveillance data to pinpoint areas 
with high concentrations of air pollutants. The analysis involved examining the data values for various
pollutants across different locations within the city. The project focused on identifying both the specific
locations experiencing elevated pollution levels and the primary air pollutants that were most prevalent in 
the dataset for those locations.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>
The findings of this data exploration project reveal that UHF42 experience the highest levels of air pollution within New York City, according to the surveillance data. Furthermore, the major air pollutant contributing to these high levels, as
indicated by the data values, are Fine particles (PM 2.5) and caused more death. This information underscores the     importance of addressing air pollution in these specific areas to mitigate the environmental threats to the urban population   of New York City.Further investigation could explore the sources of these pollutants and the potential health impacts on      the residents of these high-pollution zones.</p>
